# Health-App
I want to highlight a recent project that I worked on, a medical app that allows users to register either as a patient or a doctor. The app uses Firebase database and Java in Android Studio.

When a patient logs in, they can enter their symptoms or disease, and the app will suggest a list of doctors who specialize in that area. The patient can then select a doctor and request an appointment. The doctor receives a notification and can either accept or reject the appointment. Once the appointment is confirmed, the patient can view the appointment details and receive reminders before the appointment time.

The app also includes features such as secure messaging between patients and doctors, the ability to upload and view medical records, and a rating system for doctors.
